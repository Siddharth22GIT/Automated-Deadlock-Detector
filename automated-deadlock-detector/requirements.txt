# Requirements for Automated Deadlock Detector
#
# This project uses Python's standard library only and has no external runtime
# dependencies that need to be installed via pip. The project is tested on
# Python 3.8+ and uses modules like `tkinter` (available in the standard
# library on most Python distributions).
#
# If you add third party packages later, list them here so users can run
# `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
